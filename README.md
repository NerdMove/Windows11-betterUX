# Clean-experience
> A non-destructive opinionated registry preset to improve Windows-10 user-experience.


Those presets aims to improve quality of life rather than focusing only on optimisation.

You could also use the NTLite preset to remove all useless UWP apps (Cortana/Meteo/etc...)

If any of theses changes doesn't suits your needs, it can still be changed after the installation is done.


### Registry

All edited registry keys are user-experience settings that doesn't remove anything from your machine.

The philosophy "opt-in by default" is preferred instead of Windows's "opt-out by default";
which means if a new feature comes-in, it has good chances to be disabled (asap) here.

If you feel like something is bothering you in Windows UX, please feel free to open an issue.

### NTLite

NTLite is a Windows configuration tool.
You can use it to edit directly your OS on the fly, or the iso installation image.
I **strongly** recommend using this preset with a fresh downloaded image from [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/software-download/windows10) .
