# Windows 11 - better UX
> A non-destructive opinionated registry preset to improve Windows-10 user-experience.


Those presets aims to improve quality of life rather than focusing only on optimisation.

If any of theses changes doesn't suits your needs, it can still be changed after the installation is done.


### Registry

All edited registry keys are user-experience settings that doesn't remove anything from your machine.

The philosophy "opt-in by default" is preferred instead of Windows's "opt-out by default";
which means if a new feature comes-in, it has good chances to be disabled (asap) here.

If you feel like something is bothering you in Windows UX, please feel free to open an issue.
