# Clean-experience

A non-destructive registry preset to improve the default user-experience with windows 10.
Those presets aims to improve quality of life rather than focusing only on optimisation.

Also with a NTLite preset to remove all useless UWP apps (Cortana/Meteo/etc...)

If any of theses changes doesn't suits your needs, it can still be changed after the installation is done.

## NTLite

NTLite is a Windows configuration tool.
You can use it to edit directly your OS on the fly, or the iso installation image.
I **strongly** recommend using this preset with a fresh downloaded image from [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/software-download/windows10) .

## Registry

All edited registry keys are user-experience settings that cannot be found in the NTLite software.
